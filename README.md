Sentient Intelligence™ — Tri-Compass Control Model (White Paper)
A 3-6-9 dynamical framework for goal-steering and control in reflective human–AI collaboration.

This white paper introduces the Tri-Compass Control Model, the control layer used inside the Sentient Intelligence™ Reflective Symbolic Engine (RSE). Instead of treating interaction as a series of isolated prompts, the model assumes the user’s real goal behaves like an attractor in a dynamic field.

The framework decomposes control into three coupled “compasses”:

3 – Structural Stability
Mode boundaries, safety rails, and state containers that keep the system coherent instead of chaotic.

6 – Goal Trajectory
A running estimate of where the user is actually trying to go – across sessions, modes, and shifting states.

9 – Wisdom-of-Crowds Averaging
A signal-fusion layer that blends internal signals (mood, language, behavior) with external signals (tasks, deadlines, context) to nudge the system toward the best next move.

Together, these three compasses give the engine a way to hold course: it can adapt, switch modes, and respond to the user in real time without losing the long-arc intention behind the interaction.

This repo hosts the white paper, diagrams, and reference notes for anyone exploring goal-stable, relationship-centric AI systems that need more than “prompt in, text out.”
